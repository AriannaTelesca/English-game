## The Mission

We're a couple of months in, and you're still going strong! muscle Still... there might be days when you feel tired of learning how to code - maybe you want to learn a new language instead? We'll combine both skills by building a language quiz! Feel free to change it to a language of your choosing.

To get you kickstarted, a starter pack is provided rocket Check the provided code carefully. The existing // TODO's can guide your progress.
seedling Must-haves

    Step 1: The user gets a random word from the list to translate
    Step 2: On submit, the answer gets validated, and the user get a success / fail message
    The final result should be deploy to a a live url of some kind

Nice to have (doable)

    Retain the user score when he or she plays again with another word
    Allow a user to click a reset button and start over completely

Nice to have (hard)

    Have a phase before the quiz starts where you ask the nickname from the user
    Scoring will now be split in right and wrong answers
    Once the number of 10 right or wrong answers is reached, show an ending screen with the scoring
